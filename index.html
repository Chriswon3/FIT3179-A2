                GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is often used as a barometer for a country's economic health and development. As countries experience growth in GDP, this often translates to improvements in infrastructure, healthcare, and education, which can directly impact life expectancy and average IQ. A higher GDP typically enables more investments in medical facilities and health programs, potentially raising life expectancy. Similarly, increased educational funding and resources can elevate average IQ levels. However, the relationship between GDP and societal elements like crime rates is more nuanced. While economic prosperity can reduce motivations for certain types of crimes, disparities in wealth distribution might lead to others. Thus, while GDP can be a significant indicator of a country's overall well-being, its influence on specific societal metrics, such as life expectancy, IQ, and crime rates, can vary and is often interwoven with other factors.

            <h2 align="center">The Correlation between IQ and GDP</h2>
            <p align="center">
                The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between a country's average IQ and its GDP per capita.
                The x-axis represents the Average IQ, ranging from approximately 30 to 110,
                while the y-axis represents the GDP per capita, ranging from 0 to around 140,000.
                A concentration of data points can be observed in the IQ range of 70 to 90,
                where most countries fall in the lower to mid-range of GDP per capita.
                There is a general trend suggesting that as the Average IQ increases,
                the GDP per capita also tends to increase,
                especially noticeable for countries with an average IQ above 90.
                However, there are several outliers, particularly countries with higher GDP per capita but mid-range IQ scores.
                This suggests that while there might be a correlation between a nation's average IQ and its economic performance,
                other factors are also at play that can influence a country's GDP.

    <h2>Homicide Rates VS GDP Per Capita</h2>
    <div id="gdphomicide"></div>
    <div id="gdphomicide-paragraph">
        The bar chart titled "Homicide Rates VS GDP Per Capita" visually depicts the relationship between countries' GDP per capita and their respective homicide rates. The bars are sorted in descending order based on GDP per capita, starting from the wealthiest nations on the left to those with a lower GDP per capita on the right. The height of each bar represents the GDP per capita for a particular country, while the color intensity indicates the homicide rate, with darker shades representing higher rates. A cursory glance at the chart reveals that many countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have lighter-colored bars, suggesting lower homicide rates. Conversely, as we move towards countries with lower GDP per capita, the bars become darker, indicating a rise in homicide rates. This visualization hints at a potential inverse relationship between economic prosperity and crime rates, suggesting that a country's economic health might be inversely related to its homicide rate.
