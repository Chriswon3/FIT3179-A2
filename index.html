                GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is often used as a barometer for a country's economic health and development. As countries experience growth in GDP, this often translates to improvements in infrastructure, healthcare, and education, which can directly impact life expectancy and average IQ. A higher GDP typically enables more investments in medical facilities and health programs, potentially raising life expectancy. Similarly, increased educational funding and resources can elevate average IQ levels. However, the relationship between GDP and societal elements like crime rates is more nuanced. While economic prosperity can reduce motivations for certain types of crimes, disparities in wealth distribution might lead to others. Thus, while GDP can be a significant indicator of a country's overall well-being, its influence on specific societal metrics, such as life expectancy, IQ, and crime rates, can vary and is often interwoven with other factors.

            <h2 align="center">The Correlation between IQ and GDP</h2>
            <p align="center">
                The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between a country's average IQ and its GDP per capita.
                The x-axis represents the Average IQ, ranging from approximately 30 to 110,
                while the y-axis represents the GDP per capita, ranging from 0 to around 140,000.
                A concentration of data points can be observed in the IQ range of 70 to 90,
                where most countries fall in the lower to mid-range of GDP per capita.
                There is a general trend suggesting that as the Average IQ increases,
                the GDP per capita also tends to increase,
                especially noticeable for countries with an average IQ above 90.
                However, there are several outliers, particularly countries with higher GDP per capita but mid-range IQ scores.
                This suggests that while there might be a correlation between a nation's average IQ and its economic performance,
                other factors are also at play that can influence a country's GDP.

    <h2>Homicide Rates VS GDP Per Capita</h2>
    <div id="gdphomicide"></div>
    <div id="gdphomicide-paragraph">
        The bar chart titled "Homicide Rates VS GDP Per Capita" visually depicts the relationship between countries' GDP per capita and their respective homicide rates. The bars are sorted in descending order based on GDP per capita, starting from the wealthiest nations on the left to those with a lower GDP per capita on the right. The height of each bar represents the GDP per capita for a particular country, while the color intensity indicates the homicide rate, with darker shades representing higher rates. A cursory glance at the chart reveals that many countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have lighter-colored bars, suggesting lower homicide rates. Conversely, as we move towards countries with lower GDP per capita, the bars become darker, indicating a rise in homicide rates. This visualization hints at a potential inverse relationship between economic prosperity and crime rates, suggesting that a country's economic health might be inversely related to its homicide rate.

            The visualizations presented provide a comparative insight into the economic and health attributes of different continents. On the left, the bar chart titled "Average GDP by Continent" showcases the economic standing of continents based on their Gross Domestic Product. Europe stands out with the highest average GDP, indicating a stronger economic performance in comparison to the other continents. In contrast, Africa exhibits the lowest average GDP, suggesting economic challenges or disparities. Oceania, Americas, and Asia present mid-range values, with the Americas slightly surpassing Asia. On the right, a donut chart visualizes "Life Expectancy and the Continent". While exact numerical values aren't provided, it appears that the life expectancy across continents is somewhat evenly distributed, with no single continent dominating a significant portion of the chart. This suggests that while economic disparities exist, life expectancy might be influenced by a myriad of factors and not solely by economic performance. The distribution indicates that health outcomes, in terms of longevity, are relatively balanced across these regions, despite the economic differences highlighted in the bar chart.

    <h2>"Money can't buy happiness"</h2>
    <div class="float-container">
        <div class="float-item">
            <p align="center">
                The scatter plot titled "Happiness Score vs GDP by Country" seeks to explore the age-old adage "Money can't buy happiness." At a first glance, there seems to be a positive correlation between a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its happiness score. Most nations with higher GDPs tend to report higher happiness scores, suggesting a certain level of economic comfort or security might contribute to overall well-being. However, the dispersion of points, especially in the mid-range GDP values, underscores the complexity of this relationship. There are countries with moderate GDPs that report happiness scores comparable to those with higher GDPs, emphasizing that factors other than just economic wealth play a significant role in determining a nation's overall happiness. While money and economic stability can indeed influence well-being, the chart clearly demonstrates that they are not the sole determinants of happiness, reinforcing the truth in the statement "Money can't buy happiness."
